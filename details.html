                    Room Away From Home is a mobile application that enables the user to book a room designed to suit for COVID-19 isolation. The app features a listing page, self assessment tool, and a daily self checklist page to help the user to gain better health.

                    Room Away From Home was made as a part of my <a class="text-link" href="https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2021/spring/iat/334/d100"> User Interface Design class </a>in Simon Fraser University.

                <p>
                    I created a questionnaire in Google Survey that consists of 9 multiple choice answers and received 59 responses from users within 48 hours. These questions were shaped to help us understand the relationship between users and their needs for quarantine purposes.

                <p>
                    After the survey was done, we conclude that over 51% of the participants shared a bathroom with their household and 20% shared a bedroom, which prevents them from self isolating.

                    I then created rough sketches of my idea how the screen architecture and wireframe would look like. The main focus during this step is to help my members get on to the same page, so we can collaborate to create the same visual look troughout the app.

                   After being approved by the whole member, and we agreed upon the same design, I built the medium fidelity wireframe through Figma.

                    I created a style guide for my team mates to maintain consistency while designing the prototype. Our original color palette was more colourful but was changed for the bold blue and yellow shown below to appeal look more professional and trustworthy.

                    After having our interactive prototype, we tested our app by performing the Moderated Usability Testing where we sent the prototype to 4 people and interviewed them through video call asking them questions about their experience as well as first impressions of the app.

                    Based on the feedbacks of the User Testing, we gather the common issues and see in which part we can solve that problem and give out rationales regarding the new design. Change this please

                    Room Away From Home is an app that helps the user to book a place that is designed for Quarantine purposes. It also comes with a check-up feature that tracks the health of the user daily while also giving out useful information and activities that the user could follow throughout the day.

                    Our final project for Interface Design had shaped my skills and knowledge regarding interaction design. I learned how to do a heuristic evaluation, doing a user testing, conducting a survey until we got the perfect interface with great usability for our app. By designing health-related application, I realized how important it is as a UI Designer to give a reliable information regarding the user's health.
